# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This course's projects primarily focused on the application of various data structures in programming. Specifically, we considered the benefits and drawbacks of linked lists, binary trees, and vectors for an application that reads in a course information, sorts the information alphabetically, and outputs that sorted information.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I used the practice earlier in the course with each data structure to plan my approach before beginning to write the code. Knowledge of different data structures is very important to programming as it allows you to know which data structure is best suited for the current situation and requirements.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Everything was pretty much smooth-sailing thanks to my prior practice with the data structures. I resolved any syntax errors or bugs by tracing through my code and resolving any issues I came across.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has introduced me to multiple new data structures, and more importantly, it has shown me how to properly implement those data structures when required to do so.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I wouldn't necessarily say that this project has evolved the way I write programs to be maintainable, readable, and adaptable, but I will say that it gave me more practice in applying those concepts to my programming.
